This mod contains 70+ traits for species inspired by various Sci-Fi themes (from Star Wars, Mass Effect, Star Trek, Doctor Who, Stargate, StarCraft to Fallout). New traits are defined in a separate file, therefore vanilla traits are not affected. These traits are more or less balanced according to initial game traits. Excet machine traits are slightly better to make game more balanced. 

Supported languages are English, German, French, Spanish and Russian. Please contact me if you can translate to another language supported by the game.

Please let me know if you want some area covered by a new trait ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/850721710/133255603283620435]discussion link[/url]).

[h1] Conflicts with other mods[/h1]
The mod adds only new traits and increases window for modification of species. Only possible conflict if the same trait (names match exactly) is added by another trait mod. In case other mod changes window it depends what is changed if only interface\species_mod_window.gui it should not cause conflicts.
